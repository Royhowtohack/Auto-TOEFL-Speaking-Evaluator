Listen to part of a lecture in an economics class .
So when we talk about the demand for a product , we're referring to how much consumers want to buy it , right ? And often the demand for a product is influenced by its price .
The more expensive it becomes the less chance that people will want to buy it .
Okay. but um That's not the whole story .
Sometimes the demand for a product can also be influenced by the price of other related products .
First , there are those products called substitute goods .
If products can be substituted for one another , then um well  then they're called substitute goods .
They're similar enough to be interchangeable .
And an increase in the price of one means an increase in the demand for the other , like , uh like butter and margarine .They're pretty much used for the same purposes .Margarine is a butter substitute .And you can bake equally well with either, well when the price of butter goes up , it becomes less affordable . And so what do people do ? They buy margarine instead , right ? So  uh you see an increase in the price of butter , increases the demand for margarine .
Now , another instance where the price of one product can influence the demand of another , is uh is when you have two products that can't be used without each other , those products we call complement goods .They complement or uh complete each other , if you will , like , compact discs and compact disc players , you need both products in order to use either .
So if the price of either product increases , demand for both is likely to decrease .
And if the price of CDs goes up , well , demand for them will go down , right ? And because CDs and CD players complement each other .What will also happen is that the demand for CD players will go down , too .

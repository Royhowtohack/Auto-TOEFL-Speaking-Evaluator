This is an example of how price influences demand. For instance, if the price of CDs goes up, people might look for substitutes, like digital music, instead. Additionally, CDs and CD players are complement goods, meaning if the price of CDs increases, demand for CD players will likely drop, too, because you need both to enjoy the music.\""

For example, if the price of butter goes up, people might buy margarine instead because margarine is a substitute for butter. So, when butter gets more expensive, the demand for margarine increases. On the other hand, there are complement goods, like CDs and CD players. If the price of CDs goes up, fewer people will buy them, which means fewer people will also buy CD players because you need both to enjoy the music.\""

It is necessary for the student to engage with the content of the lecture and provide an explanation of how substitute and complement goods influence demand. A possible response could be: \"Substitute goods are products that can replace each other, like butter and margarine. If the price of butter goes up, people will buy more margarine instead, increasing its demand. Complement goods, like CDs and CD players, are products that are used together. If the price of CDs increases, the demand for both CDs and CD players will likely decrease because people won't buy as many CDs, which means they won't need as many players.\""

        "original_response": "According to the lectures, the substitute goods and the completion goods will impact the people in these three ways. The first one is price, and number two is the related products, and the third one is the composition goods. As for the price, the higher the price becomes, the lower the people will buy it. For the related products, the substitute goods and purpose will divide the amount of people who buy it, just like the butcher, alternative, and price. For the composition goods, that means you have to buy two to achieve your goals. If you only buy a single one, you can't achieve your goals. Just like the CD and CD players, you have to buy both so that you can take a video or take a photo. If you only buy the CD or the CD players, it will not work.",

First, when the price of a product increases, people tend to buy less of it. For example, if the price of butter goes up, people might buy margarine instead because margarine is a substitute for butter. Second, related products also play a role. Substitute goods can affect how many people choose to buy a product based on its alternatives. Finally, complement goods are products that are used together. For instance, you need both CDs and CD players to enjoy music. If the price of CDs goes up, people will buy fewer CDs, which will also lead to a decrease in demand for CD players since they are used together. If you only have one and not the other, you can't fully enjoy the product.\""

This is how substitute goods influence demand; for example, if butter becomes too expensive, people might choose margarine instead. On the other hand, complement goods work differently.

Now , listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class .
Consider this experiment .Two groups of people were asked to watch TV and while they were watching a picture flashed on the screen less than a second very quickly , so it was barely noticeable .The picture was of a boy with a birthday cake .Now , like I said , there were 2 groups , and each group saw a slightly different version of the picture .One group got the boy looking angry .
In fact , he was actually throwing the cake on the floor .The other group got a picture of the boy smiling, happy , holding out the cake like he was offering it same boy , same cake , but different emotions expressed in each picture .Everyone was then asked to look at a different image .
Now this is a third image , right ? Again , it's the boy and the cake , but this time the image stayed on the screen .In this picture , the boy is just holding the cake , basically no emotion on his face , everything very neutral .Now , remember , nobody knew they'd already seen a picture of this boy .After a minute , everyone was asked to describe the boy's personality , those who had been exposed to the image of the angry boy , they generally described the boy's personality negatively .
Those who had earlier seen the happy boy described him well positively .

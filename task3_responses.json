One group saw a picture of a boy looking angry, while the other group saw a boy smiling and holding the cake. After that, they showed a third image of the same boy holding the cake with no emotion on his face. Then, they asked everyone to describe the boy's personality. Those who saw the angry boy described him negatively, while those who saw the happy boy described him positively. This shows how subliminal perception works, as the earlier images influenced how they perceived the boy in the final image.\""

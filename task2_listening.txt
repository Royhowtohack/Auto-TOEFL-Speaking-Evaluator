Now listen to two students discussing the article .
What do you think of the proposal?
I think it'll work .I mean the range of the station now is basically limited to the campus, and so it's basically just a few programs, mainly for students .
Yeah.
Well if this proposal goes through , there will be more programs and it'll give the students more professional experience as they experiment with programming for a much larger you know real life audience.And stuff like that will give them a better shot at getting a job after they graduate.
Of course.
Besides the whole university will benefit from it.
What do you mean ?
Well you know my friend Tony, right ? He told me that the radio station at his university did something like this about 5 years ago ,
Andï¼Ÿ
Well it's a success.They are making a lot of money out of commercials , and they are using it to offer more scholarships and to help fund projects to renovate the facilities of other programs.
That sounds really good .
